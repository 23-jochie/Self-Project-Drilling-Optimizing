# Drilling Optimization from Mud Log 16A78-32
This project analyzes mud log data from well 16A78-32 to identify factors affecting ROP and detect anomalies. ROP shows strong negative correlation with WOB, mud temperature, CO₂, and pump pressure, and weaker positive correlation with RPM and SPM1. Findings reveal sweet spots to maximize ROP, reduce NPT, and cut costs.
