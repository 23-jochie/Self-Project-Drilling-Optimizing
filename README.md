# Self-Project-Drilling-Optimizing
This project analyzes mud log data from well 16A78-32 to identify factors affecting ROP and detect anomalies. ROP shows strong negative correlation with WOB, mud temperature, COâ‚‚, and pump pressure, and weaker positive correlation with RPM and SPM1. Findings reveal sweet spots to maximize ROP, reduce NPT, and cut costs.
